# Register with Microsoft Collaborate

The Microsoft Collaborate program requires registration. If you have an account in Dev Center  you can use it to login and interact with Collaborate. 
Before you can download content or submit feedback, you need to join an engagement. Some engagements require invitation from Microsoft **Engagement Owner** or **Power User** (when your organization is already added to an engagement). Other engagements are **Open** for users to join.

Microsoft Collaborate is available at [https://aka.ms/collaborate](https://aka.ms/collaborate).

## The account signup process

> [!NOTE]
> In some cases, the screens and fields you see when registering for an account may vary slightly from what is outlined below. The basic information and process will be the same.

1.  Navigate to the [https://aka.ms/collaborate](https://aka.ms/collaborate) page. 
2.  If you're not already signed in with a Microsoft account, sign in now, or create a new Microsoft account. The Microsoft account you use here will be what you use to sign in to Microsoft Collaborate.
3.  If you are not enrolled in Microsoft Collaborate the  system will automatically redirect you to the [registration page](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=851519).
4.  Select the country/region in which you live, or where your business is located. You won't be able to change this later.
5.  Select your account type (individual or company). You won't be able to change this later, so be sure to choose the right type of account.
6.  Enter the **publisher display name** that you wish to use (50 characters or fewer). Select this carefully, as this name will be used when you interact with Collaborate (download content, submit feedback and etc.). For company accounts, be sure to use your organization's registered business name or trade name. Note that if you enter a name that someone else has already selected, or if it appears that someone else has the rights to use that name, we will not allow you to use that name. 

  > [!NOTE]
  > Make sure you have the rights to use the name you enter here. If someone else has trademarked or copyrighted the name you picked, your account could be closed. If someone else is using a publisher display name for which you hold the trademark or other legal right, [contact Microsoft](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=233777).    

7.  Enter the contact info you want to use for your account.

  > [!NOTE]
  > We'll use this info to contact you about account-related matters. For example, you'll receive an email confirmation message after you complete your registration.

   If you are registering as a company, you'll also need to enter the name, email address, and phone number of the person who will approve your company's account.

8.  Review your account info and confirm that everything is correct. Then, read and accept the terms and conditions of the [Collaborate Agreement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=849107). Check the box to indicate you have read and accepted these terms.

9.  Click **Finish** to confirm your registration.  

## Additional guidelines for company accounts

When creating a company account, we suggest that you follow these guidelines, especially if more than one person needs to access the account.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To allow multiple users to access your Dev Center account, we recommend using Azure Active Directory to assign roles to individual users. Each user can then access the Dev Center account by signing in with their individual Azure AD credentials. For more info, see [Manage account users](manage-account-users.md).

-   Create your Microsoft account using an email address that doesn't already belong to you or another individual, such as MyCompany_DevCenter@outlook.com. You may not be able to use an email address at your company's domain, especially if your company already uses Azure AD.
-   If you plan to join Windows program for app development in future and want to reuse your dev center account then it is recommended that you enroll to Windows program first and then join Microsoft Collaborate. Otherwise you might have to create separate accounts for these programs.
-   Add a company phone number that does not require an extension and is accessible to key team members.

## How to associate your Dev Center account with Azure Active Directory and manage users

You can use Azure Active Directory to add and manage additional users in your Dev Center account. You can define the role or custom permissions that each user should have. 

In order to add and manage account users, you must first associate your Dev Center account with your organization's Azure Active Directory. 

This section describes how to do the following:

-   [Associate Azure Active Directory with your Dev Center account](associate-azure-ad-with-dev-center.md)
-   [Add users, groups, and Azure AD applications to your Dev Center account](add-users-groups-and-azure-ad-applications.md)
-   [Set roles and custom permissions for account users](set-custom-permissions-for-account-users.md)

> [!NOTE]
> Dev Center leverages Azure Active Directory for multi-user management and roles assignment. If your organization already uses Office 365 or other business services from Microsoft, you already have an AAD. Otherwise, you can create a new AAD tenant from within Dev Center at no additional charge.

## How to log in to the MS Collaborate portal

1. Navigate to MS Collaborate: [https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/dashboard/collaborate/](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/dashboard/collaborate/)

2.	You will be asked for credentials to log in. This is your Dev Center account credentials. If you have more than one account, select the appropriate account that you used to sign up for Dev Center. This can be a Microsoft alias account (MSA) or an Active Directory organization account. If you have not logged in before, you will need to enter your password.

3. After logging in, the Microsoft Collaborate dashboard will appear, showing you the engagements, packages, and feedback you are configured to see. If you are not a member of any programs or engagements, the lists will be blank. You need to be added to Engagements to interact with content or feedback. 

## Troubleshooting registration issues

There are several issues that can cause difficulty signing-in.
### Invitations
If you have been invited to join Dev Center account, you need to accept the invitation before you can access Collaborate portal. If you see an error message similar to shown below, it means that you have two accounts with Microsoft using the same email address. 

> You have been invited to access ... application as ... .<br> 
> However, we are not able to create this work or school account because ... is a domain that is federated with your on-premises AD.<br> 
> Please contact your admin to ensure you are properly configured in your on-premises AD and you can re-attempt to accept this invite.<br>

The information below is intended to give you enough info to unblock yourself.
Microsoft now is limiting usage of personal Microsoft accounts linked to a work/school email address, when the email domain is configured in Azure AD. If users have configured their work accounts as sign-in names for Microsoft account MSA then they would be prevented from accessing Collaborate Portal. In this scenario, users will have to rename their personal Microsoft account, by following [these steps](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows/rename-personal-microsoft-account/):

1. Sign in to the [Your Info page](https://account.microsoft.com/profile) of your Microsoft account.
2. Select **Manage how you sign in to Microsoft**.
3. Look under the **Account alias** section.
  * If you already have a personal email address listed there, you can skip this step.
  * If your work or school email address is the only one listed, enter your personal email address, or get a new one from Microsoft, and select **Add email** or **Add phone number**.
 4. If your personal email address does not have **(primary alias)** listed next to it, select **Make primary** to set it as your primary alias.
 5. Select **Remove** next to your work email address to remove it from your account.

Going forward, youâ€™ll sign in to your personal Microsoft account with your personal email address. You might need to sign in again to some apps and Windows devices.

Once completed proceed with accepting the Collaborate invitations that are send from [Microsoft Invitations](mailto:invites@microsoft.com) alias.  More information about blocking the ability to create a new personal Microsoft using a work/school email address is available in this [article](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/enterprisemobility/2016/09/15/cleaning-up-the-azure-ad-and-microsoft-account-overlap/).
