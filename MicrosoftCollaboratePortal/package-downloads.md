# Working with Package Downloads

The Microsoft Collaborate Portal makes it possible to find packages and download individual files. Packages available for download are associated with one or more engagements.  You can only see packages associated with engagements you belong to.

### Filtering Packages

The **Packages** page can be filtered based on multiple criteria, including:
- words in the name, 
- the program or engagement that the package belongs to, 
- when the package was published, 
- the type of files in the package, and
- by using keywords.

For example, if you are looking for a specific Windows Build package and you know the build number, you could enter it as a filter. Each filter box is cumulative, so you can start with fewer filters and add more to limit the number of packages returned until you find what you are looking for. You can also sort the list of packages by column to help with locating packages.

### Download Manager

If you want to download packages with multiple files or large packages, we recommend you download the [**Download Manager**](..). This client application connects to MS Collaborate using the same credentials you use to log in to the MS Collaborate Portal. All packages you can see on MS Collaborate will appear in the Download Manager as well.

## How to download files using the Microsoft Collaborate Portal

1.	From the Dashboard, click on Packages" to get to the **Packages** page, where you will see a list of all packages available to download.

2.	Search or use "Advanced Filters" to find the file you would like to download. The filters are cumulative to help narrow the search. Use the "Clear Filters" button to remove all filters.
- Click the "Advanced Filters" icon to toggle display of the Advanced Filters fields.

3.	When you locate the package you want to download, click on it to open the package.  You will find all of the details about the package as well as a list of files you can download.
 
4.	In the MS Collaborate interface, you can only download one file at a time.  Click on a file to initiate the download. 

## Using the Distribution Manager for multi-file downloads

<!-- Are distribution manager and download manager two different things? If not, group the Download title above here and be sure naming is consistent. -->

The Distribution Manager is a ClickOnce client application that uses the same Dev Center account you use to access Microsoft Collaborate in the web browser.  If you are permissioned to see downloads in the browse, you will see the same packages in the Distribution Manager.
Use the Distribution Manager to download multi-file packages and to download multiple packages at one time.

### How to install the Download Manager

1.	From the Packages page, click the Distribution Manager button at the top of the page.
2.	Click Open on the message:
 
3.	Click Install in the Application Install dialog box.
 
4.	If you are already logged into Dev Center, the Distribution Manager will launch and sign you in.

### How to Log into the Distribution Manager

If you are not already logged into Microsoft Collaborate, or if you are using an MSA account to access the site, you may need to log in to the Distribution Manager again.  This will be using the same account you used to log into the web portal.

1.	Launch the Distribution Manager application on your computer:
- Select the Distribution Manager button on the Packages page in the Microsoft Collaborate portal
- Navigate to Distribution Manager in your computerâ€™s list of applications.

2.	You will see the same log in screen you see when you log into Dev Center or Microsoft Collaborate.

3.	Select the appropriate account, enter your password, and Distribution Manager will connect to your Microsoft Collaborate account.

### How to Download Packages using Distribution Manager
