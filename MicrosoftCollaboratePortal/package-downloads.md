# Working with Packages to Download Content

The Microsoft Collaborate (MS Collaborate) provides two mechanisms for downloading content:
1. MS Collaborate **Packages page on the portal** enables you to find packages and download individual files from a package. 
2. MS Collaborate **Distribution Manager** can be installed on your local machine to download multiple files and packages at once.

Which packages you can download depends on the engagements you belong to.  Content Publishers publish packages to specific engagements. If you are a participant member of an engagement, you will be able to see the packages for that engagement.  This means users can only see packages associated with engagements they belong to.

Content Publisher is a permissions role in MS Collaborate associated with engagements.  At this time, only Microsoft users can publish to engagements, but in the future it will be possible for non-Microsoft users to be provisioned to publish content to the engagement on a case by case basis.  Engagement Owners define which users have Content Publisher permissions.

All participants in an engagement can download packages associated with the engagement.

## Finding Packages in the MS Collaborate portal

On the **Packages** page, you can filter and search for packages based on multiple criteria, including:
- words in the name, 
- the Program or Engagement that the package belongs to, 
- when the package was published, 
- the type of files in the package, and
- by using keywords.

For example, if you are looking for a specific Windows Build package and you know the build number, you could enter it as a filter. Each filter box is cumulative, so you can start with fewer filters and add more to limit the number of packages returned until you find what you are looking for. You can also sort the list of packages by column to help with locating packages.

The Disribution Manager has basic search/sort capabilities, but the portal provides a richer search/filter experience.  If you have many packages available to you, it is recommended that you use the portal's search to find the right package, and then search on the package name in the Distribution Manager.

## How to download files from the MS Collaborate portal

1. From the Dashboard, click on "Packages" to get to the **Packages** page, where you will see a list of all packages available to download.

2. Search or use **Advanced Filters** to find the package you would like to download. The filters are cumulative to help narrow the search. Use the "Clear Filters" button to remove all filters.
- Click the "Advanced Filters" icon to toggle display of the "Advanced Filters" fields.

4. Click on each file to initiate the download. In the MS Collaborate portal you can download one file at a time. 

## Using Distribution Manager for multi-file downloads

If you want to download a whole packages with multiple files or large packages, we recommend installing the **Distribution Manager**.  

This client application connects using the same credentials you use to log in to the MS Collaborate portal. All of the same packages you can see on MS Collaborate will appear in the Distribution Manager.

In addition to downloading multiple files, you can queue many packages to run in the background and you can also customize download settings to address connection issues.
