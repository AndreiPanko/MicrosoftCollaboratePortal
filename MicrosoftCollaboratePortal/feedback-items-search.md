## How to create and save queries

There are a few kinds of queries that can be saved with an Engagement. You can open the Engagement to see the Feedback work item types and the queries available.

- **My Queries** are created by you and are visible only to you. This is a private query.
- **Shared Queries** are created by participant users in the Engagement. This query is visible to all users in the Engagement.
- **Pre-Defined Queries** are created by the *Engagement Owner* and are available to all in the Engagement. This query is available to all users but is only editable by the *Engagement Owner*.

To create queries, you must be within the context of a specific engagement.  

1. Navigate to an Engagement and click on one of the options within the Engagement page to get to the list of feedback that you want in the query.
