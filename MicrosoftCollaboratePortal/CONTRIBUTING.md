## How to make a change

| To suggest a change to the docs, follow these steps: |  |
| ------------------- | -------- |
| 1. If you're viewing a Docs.microsoft.com page, click the **Edit** button in the upper right of the page.  You will be redirected to the corresponding Markdown source file in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/avatars). | ![Edit Button](images/edit_button.jpg) |
| 2. If you don't already have a GitHub account, click **Sign Up** in the upper right and create a new account. | ![Signup button](images/signup.PNG)|
| 3. On the corresponding GitHub page that opens, click Edit (the pencil icon). | ![Pencil button](images/pencil_button.jpg)|
| 4. In the Edit file pane, use Markdown language to make changes to the content. ([How to write markdown.](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/))| ![Edit File](images/edit_file.jpg)|
| 5. Click Preview changes to verify the formatting looks as expected. | ![Preview changes](images/preview_changes.jpg)|
| 6. When you're done, scroll to the bottom of the page where you will see one of the follow: <br> **Propose file change** - displays when you have read-only access, a forked "patch" branch will be created. After you click "Propose file change", you will be presented with a "Comparing changes" page, allowing you to verify your changes. Then click the "Create pull request" button to submit your changes. At this point you are finished! | ![Propose a change](images/propose.jpg)|
| If you have been granted special permission for this content, step #6 may look like this instead: **Commit changes** - giving you two options for saving your changes: **"Commit directly to the `<branch-name>` branch"**, where `<branch-name>` is the name of the branch you were on when you clicked the "Edit" button. This applies your changes directly to the branch instead of using a pull request. At this point you are finished! | ![Commit changes](images/commit_changes.jpg) |


After you submit changes (via a pull request), they will be reviewed by a member of the documentation team. If your request is accepted, updates are published to [https://docs.microsoft.com/avatars](https://docs.microsoft.com/avatars).

*For internal review only, you can see your changes at [https://review.docs.microsoft.com/avatars](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/avatars/?branch=master).

## Working with Branches

The [Avatars GitHub repository](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/avatars) utilizes two main parent branches: [Master](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/avatars/tree/master), this content can be reviewed on the [staging site](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/avatars), and [Live](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/avatars/tree/live), for content appearing on the [live site](https://docs.microsoft.com/avatars). 

When making contributions, please submit your Pull Request (PR) to the **Master** branch. This branch can be viewed on the staging site and should only contain contributions that are ready to be published live. You may also create and submit a branch with your own unique branch name which can be selected and viewed in the staging site. (The **Live** branch is only allowed for use by the content administrators.)
