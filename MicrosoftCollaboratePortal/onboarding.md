# Onboarding to Microsoft Collaborate

The Microsoft Collaborate (MS Collaborate) portal is embedded into the Microsoft Dev Center Dashboard. You can use your Dev Center account to log in and interact with MS Collaborate.  Before you can download content or submit feedback, you need to be invited to an MS Collaborate engagement. This can be done by either your Microsoft engagement owner, or by your company "Organization Admin" if your organization is already added to an Engagement.

## How to register with Microsoft Developer Center

There are two ways to register with Dev Center: 
1. as an individual using a Microsoft Account (MSA), or
2. as a member of an organization with Azure Active Directory set up.  

Using Azure Active Directory is the preferred method for organizations collaborating with Microsoft.  If the organization is already set up in Dev Center, MS Collaborate simply uses the existing accounts.  

If your organization has not yet been onboarded to Dev Center, or for additional help, see the following articles:
- [Opening a developer account](//docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/publish/opening-a-developer-account)
- [Creating a company account](//docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/publish/opening-a-developer-account#additional-guidelines-for-company-accounts)


## How to log in to the MS Collaborate portal

1. Navigate to MS Collaborate: [https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/dashboard/collaborate/](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/dashboard/collaborate/)

2.	You will be asked for credentials to log in. This is your Dev Center account credentials. If you have more than one account, select the appropriate account that you used to sign up for Dev Center. This can be a Microsoft alias account (MSA) or an Active Directory organization account. If you have not logged in before, you will need to enter your password.

3. After logging in, the Microsoft Collaborate dashboard will appear, showing you the engagements, packages, and feedback you are configured to see. If you are not a member of any programs or engagements, the lists will be blank. You need to be added to Engagements to interact with content or feedback. 

## Associate your Dev Center account with Azure Active Directory and find your admin for company users

If your organization uses corporate accounts to log onto Dev Center, you will need to contact your Dev Center admin and have that person add you to the appropriate Azure Active Directory (AAD) seller ID for your company. However, before an admin can [add and manage account users](//docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/publish/add-users-groups-and-azure-ad-applications), you must first connect your AAD and personal Dev Center accounts. Follow the instructions in this article:
- [Associate Azure Active Directory with your Dev Center account](//docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/publish/associate-azure-ad-with-dev-center).

> [!NOTE]
>Dev Center leverages Azure Active Directory for multi-user management and roles assignment. If your organization already uses Office 365 or other business services from Microsoft, you already have AAD. Otherwise, you can create a new AAD tenant from within Dev Center at no additional charge.

To find your MS Collaborate Engagement "Organization Admin" after logging in:

1. Navigate to the Engagement you are interested in and click on the Engagement title.
2. The page that appears has a link to send a notification to your organizationâ€™s Power User (admin) for that Engagement.
